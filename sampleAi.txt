Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines capable of intelligent behavior. The concept of AI was first introduced by John McCarthy in 1956 during the Dartmouth Conference, which is considered the birthplace of AI research. AI systems can perform tasks such as speech recognition, natural language processing, image classification, and decision-making.

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on building algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning are the three primary types of machine learning. In supervised learning, models are trained on labeled datasets, such as predicting house prices based on historical data. Unsupervised learning involves finding patterns in unlabeled datasets, for example, clustering customer segments. Reinforcement learning allows agents to learn by interacting with an environment, like training a robot to navigate a maze.

Deep Learning, a specialized branch of ML, utilizes artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used for image recognition tasks, whereas Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are applied in sequence data, such as time series forecasting or language modeling. Popular frameworks for implementing deep learning models include TensorFlow and PyTorch.

AI applications have grown significantly in healthcare, finance, autonomous vehicles, and natural language processing. Notably, OpenAI developed the GPT series of language models capable of generating human-like text. Ethical considerations, such as bias, transparency, and accountability, remain critical challenges for AI developers.

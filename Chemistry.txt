Chemical reactions involve the transformation of reactants into products through the breaking and forming of chemical bonds. Balanced chemical equations obey the law of conservation of mass, ensuring the number of atoms of each element remains the same. Stoichiometry allows chemists to calculate the quantities of reactants needed and products formed. Types of reactions include synthesis, decomposition, single replacement, double replacement, and combustion reactions. Mastery of these reactions is essential for laboratory experiments, industrial production, and understanding natural chemical processes.

Factors such as temperature, concentration, surface area, and the presence of catalysts influence the rate of chemical reactions. Catalysts increase reaction rates without being consumed, while inhibitors slow down reactions. Endothermic reactions absorb energy from the surroundings, whereas exothermic reactions release energy, often in the form of heat or light. Understanding energy changes is crucial for applications such as fuel combustion, biochemical processes, and industrial chemical synthesis.

Chemical equilibrium occurs when the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal, resulting in constant concentrations of reactants and products. Le Chatelier's principle predicts how changes in temperature, pressure, or concentration affect the position of equilibrium. Redox reactions, involving the transfer of electrons, are fundamental in processes like corrosion, respiration, and electrochemical cells. Acids and bases participate in neutralization reactions, producing salts and water, and the pH of solutions plays a key role in chemical and biological systems.

Practical applications of chemical reactions include the manufacture of fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, plastics, and fuels. Laboratory techniques, such as titration, distillation, and chromatography, rely on chemical principles to analyze and purify substances. Safety precautions, proper handling of reagents, and correct disposal of chemical waste are critical in both educational and industrial settings.

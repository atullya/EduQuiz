In 1492, Christopher Columbus embarked on a voyage sponsored by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain, aiming to find a westward sea route to Asia. Instead, he accidentally reached the islands of the Caribbean, marking the beginning of European exploration of the Americas. Columbus’s first landfall was on an island he named San Salvador, which is part of the present-day Bahamas.

The success of this expedition led to further voyages, opening up trade routes and establishing European colonies in the New World. Columbus’s journeys also had profound effects on indigenous populations, including the spread of European diseases and cultural exchanges.

During the Age of Exploration, other notable explorers like Ferdinand Magellan, who led the first circumnavigation of the Earth, and Vasco da Gama, who discovered a sea route to India around the Cape of Good Hope, made significant contributions to mapping the globe. These expeditions expanded scientific knowledge, improved navigation techniques, and paved the way for the modern era of global trade and cultural exchange.

The Columbian Exchange, named after Columbus, refers to the widespread transfer of plants, animals, culture, human populations, and ideas between the Americas and the Old World. Scholars consider this period pivotal in shaping the economic, political, and social structures of the modern world.
